### In this configuration, the effective cache size of how much memory is
### available for disk caching is 75% with a shared buffer cache of 20%.
### The target workload is read-only and 120% of total memory so page
### reclaim activity may occur depending on the randomness of the benchmark.
### The page cache is not flushed after the database is populated for the
### test and starts cache-hot.
