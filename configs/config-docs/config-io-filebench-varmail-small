### This configuration uses the varmail personality for a working set that
### is 20% of RAM. This workload should be similar to a simple mail server
### that stores one mail in one file. The IO pattern is small create-append-sync,
### read-append-sync and read/delete operations in a single directory. It runs
### for a range of clients. More can be read about the stock personalities at
