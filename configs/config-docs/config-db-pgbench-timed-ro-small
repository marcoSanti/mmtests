### In this configuration, the effective cache size of how much memory is
### available for disk caching is 75% with a shared buffer cache of 20%.
### The target workload is read-only and 60% of the shared buffer size so it
### should fit completely in memory. The page cache is not flushed after
### the database is populated for the test and starts cache-hot.
