### In this configuration, the effective cache size of how much memory is
### available for disk caching is 75% with a shared buffer cache of 20%.
### The target workload is read-only and 60% of total memory so it should
### still fit completely within memory but there will be some shuffling
### between the shared buffer cache and the OS cache. There may be some
### reclaim due to NUMA artifactors or other factors related to problems
### with the sizing. The page cache is not flushed after the database
### is populated for the test and starts cache-hot.
