### lmbench is just running the lat_ctx test and is an approximate
### measure of context switch latency but with significant caveats.
### switch latency.

### The benchmark passes a token around a ring of pipe-connected processes
### and on receiving the token, it does a small amount of work on a
### buffer. It measures the time to do the token receive, token pass and
### data process but it has a significant number of weaknesses.

### The most basic definition for the cost of a context switch is the
### overhead of suspending a process, saving the hardware state, select the
### next process, restore the hardware state and then start executing it.
### That in itself does not have a fixed cost as it matters a lot which CPU
### the wakee previously ran on. lmbench also measures more than just the
### context switch because it includes the time to do some work on a buffer
### which means it's also counting the cost of populating the cache with the
### working set of the process which also has variable cost.
###

### The cost of just the context switch is variable because it depends
### heavily on where the wakee process previously ran. lmbench initially forks
### all its helpers so the benchmark can be gamed by initially stacking all
### the processes on the same CPU which, in general, is a poor decision as any
### long-lived processes must then be load balanced. There is more variability
### depending on what CPU the wakee process previously ran, the CPU cache
### locality and the state of the CPU cache. This cost will be effectively
### random due to the variable cost of migrating data between caches
### depending on locality and whether there are any cache conflicts.
###
### The cache conflict is interesting. Depending on exactly where the
### "work buffer" is located, it may or may not force the data from the waking
### process out of the CPU cache. The "work buffer" is only read so in theory,
### the data can be shared between multiple CPU caches. However, the cost will
### depend heavily on whether the waker and wakee use the same cache lines to
### store the data. In the ideal case, both waker and wakee data can be both
### in the cache but if they hash to the same lines, the wakee will invalidate
### the data of the waker which later fetches the same data from memory. This
### will not be reliably reproducible but may sometimes results in "runs
### where every iteration is bad" and "runs where every iteration is good"
### on the exact same kernel simply because of what pages were used.
### 
### In theory, the OS can mitigate this class of problem using cache coloring
### in allocation algorithms but previous research indicated that the cost of
### a cache coloring algorithm exceeds the benefit and hence Linux doesn't
### implement one. Consequently, the results from lmbench_ctx will never be
### reliably reproducible. An interesting side note is that lmbench_ctx also
### depends on whether THP is used and whether the benchmark is run early in
### the lifetime of the system or not as these affect the cache color of the
### pages used for the work buffers.
### 
### The cache location and locality are both significant source of randomness
### that makes results from this benchmark extremely difficult to reliably
### reproduce and the results can vary depending on exactly when the benchmark
### was run. It can be stabilised if the fork() does not spread new tasks
### on available CPUs), rarely load balances and runs on a subset of CPUs
### (ideally 2 but potentially more if the time to process the work buffer is
### high). That would maximise cache locality and be closer to measuring the
### context of the context switch itself.
###
### In general, treat results from this benchmark with a large grain of salt.
