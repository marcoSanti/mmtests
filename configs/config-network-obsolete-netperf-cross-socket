### netperf-udp is a UDP_STREAM netperf run on a loopback device. As
### this benchmark is very sensitive to scheduling when running in
### loopback mode, the client and server are bound to cores that are
### on the same socket but are not hyper-thread siblings.
###
### netperf-tcp is a TCP_STREAM netperf run on a loopback device. The
### client and server are bound to CPUs similar to the netperf-udp
### benchmark.
