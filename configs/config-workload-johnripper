### John the Ripper is a password cracked that can be parallelised. This is
### user-space bound with little or no system CPU usage unless there are more
### threads than CPUs in the system. It's suitable as a CPU benchmark, should
### also be able to detect indirect problems such as cpufreq bugs forcing lower
### frequencies to be used unnecessarily and detect some scheduler anomalies.
