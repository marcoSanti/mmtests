### Sysbench is a suite of microbenchmarks. This runs the mutex microbench which
### has threads loop on locking and unlocking a pthread mutex with a very small
### critical region, which just increments a global variable. The mutex to be used
### at every iteration is chosen randomly, out of a pool of 4096 locks, and
### therefore the degree of contention (blocking/waking) can vary significantly
### with increasing thread counts.
